This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## User Manual

In order to successfully use LinkScholar, an individual must first create an account with their UNCG email and student ID. Upon creation of the account the user is then directed to sign-in. Once the individual has logged in to their account they can then proceed to the “Connect” page. From there they will be presented with a list of options (fields of studies) to select from. Depending on their area of expertise and knowledge, the user can select whatever interests them and what they would like to pursue in research opportunities. After that the user will be presented with a “Connect” button that they can click. The algorithm is run and the match has been made, the user can now click “back” and view their dashboard. The dashboard now presents to the user professors who have the same field of study and interest that they can research under. Contact information of the matched professors will also be displayed so the student can reach out.
